Gwiad is a framework for building a Web Server with dynamic plugin loading
based on AWS.

It provides a simple interface to build plugins in Ada. When a
plugin is placed in Gwiad plugin directory it is automatically
loaded. Gwiad plugins are divided into two categories :

 - Web applications that register dispatchers such as virtual host
   dispatchers or regexp dispatchers.
 - Services provider that can be used by all websites plugins.

Plugins can be added at run time. They only need to be put in the plugins directory.
If a plugin fails to load it is automatically disabled.

Gwiad provides a simple web administration tool to disable a running
plugin. A current limitation makes it impossible to completely remove the
plugin. To update a plugin to a new version you'll need to restart Gwiad.

Gwiad comes with a simple server named argwiad.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to build and install Gwiad.

There are several subdirectories:

'admin'             holds the admin interface for services and websites

                    some scripts
